**Unable to Connect to World** means that the Bedrock client cannot find the server specified. This is most likely not a Geyser issue itself, unless Geyser is not running.
There are various fixes for this on our wiki, please see [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Fixing-'Unable-to-Connect-to-World').
