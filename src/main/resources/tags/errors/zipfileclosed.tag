If **Geyser** is showing this error, there are are a few likely causes:
A: You reloaded Geyser or the server, which is unsupported. Please do a full restart instead.
B: Your Geyser jar is corrupted, and you need to re-download it.
C: Geyser failed to start for a different reason. Check the start of your server logs for a different error explaining why it failed to start.
