We do not provide support for cracked (offline mode) servers as they allow pirated accounts to join which are illegal. While Geyser can run potentially run on cracked servers, you are on your own and should seek support elsewhere for any issues that arise. For allowing Bedrock players without a Minecraft Java Edition account on your Geyser server, please use Floodgate with online mode set to true in [`server.properties`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Server.properties).
