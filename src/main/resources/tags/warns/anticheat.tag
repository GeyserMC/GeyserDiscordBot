title: :warning: Geyser Interference with Anticheat on Large Servers
color: warns

---

Geyser does not perfectly replicate a Java client; anticheat on servers **especially Hypixel** can pick up irregular behavior from Geyser and ban you. Please exercise caution when going on large servers!
This only applies when you are trying to join another server (that isn't hosted by you) with a Geyser Proxy such as GeyserConnect.
