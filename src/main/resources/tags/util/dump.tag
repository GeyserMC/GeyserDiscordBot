A Geyser dump is a way of providing us with a bunch of useful information about your server and Geyser config without giving us any IPs or sensitive data.
- Run `geyser dump` in the server console or `/geyser dump` in the in‑game chat.
- Then, copy the Geyser dump link it gives you and paste it here.
