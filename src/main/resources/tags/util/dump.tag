Run `geyser dump` (server console) / `/geyser dump` (ingame chat) on your Geyser instance or server, then copy the link it will give you and paste it here. A Geyser dump is a way of providing us with a bunch of useful information about your server and Geyser config. This doesn't include any IPs or sensitive data.

If you use the Geyser Standalone GUI then it is inside the `Commands` menu as seen below.
