Run `geyser dump full` (server console) / `/geyser dump full` (ingame chat) on your Geyser instance or server, then copy the link it will give you and paste it here. This will show all IPs on your dump so we can correctly identify your issue.

If you use the Geyser Standalone GUI then it is inside the `Commands` menu as seen below.
