An entire log file is a very useful way of debugging any issues with plugins. Sometimes a snippet of a log doesn't tell the whole story!

You can upload your log file into this channel, or you can use https://mclo.gs/ to censor all IPs present in your log.
For BungeeCord (not Waterfall) there is a `proxy.log.0` file in the root and for everything else it is `latest.log` in `logs` folder.
