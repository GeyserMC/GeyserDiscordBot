Spark is a plugin that helps you monitor performance for you server.

To record performance on your server use:
`/spark profiler --thread * --timeout 60`. This will run for 60 seconds then it will automatically stop.
It'll probably lag the server a good deal but it'll give us a link we might be able to process.
