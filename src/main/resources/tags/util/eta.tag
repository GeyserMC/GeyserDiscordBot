It'll be done when it's done. Considering the type of software Geyser is, we can't just throw out ETA's left and right. It could be a matter of a few hours before your feature or bug is fixed, or a few months. Sometimes we hit roadblocks or run into issues that we didn't expect. Please be patient; we'll get around to it when we have time or more information is learned.
