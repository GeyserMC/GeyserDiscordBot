To check whether Bedrock players can connect or if port forwarding for Geyser is working, run the following command in your Minecraft server console:

`geyser connectiontest <ip>:<port>`

For example, if your server is running on the IP 12.34.56.78 and port 19132, you would run `geyser connectiontest 12.34.56.78:19132`.
