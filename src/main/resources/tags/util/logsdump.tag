A Geyser logs dump is a way of providing us with a bunch of useful information about your server and Geyser config with the logs from your server.
- Run `geyser dump logs` in the server console or `/geyser dump logs` in the in‑game chat.
- Then, copy the Geyser dump link it gives you and paste it here.
