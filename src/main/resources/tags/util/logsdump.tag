Run `geyser dump logs` (server console) / `/geyser dump logs` (ingame chat) on your Geyser instance or server, then copy the link it will give you and paste it here. This will auto upload the server logs to mclo.gs and provide its url into the dump.

If you use the Geyser Standalone GUI then it is inside the `Commands` menu as seen below.
