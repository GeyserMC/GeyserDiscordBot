Run `geyser dump logs` (server console) / `/geyser dump logs` (ingame chat) on your Geyser instance or server, then copy the link it will give you and paste it here. This will automatically upload the server logs to [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) and add the link in the dump.

If you use the Geyser Standalone GUI then it is inside the `Commands` menu as seen below.
