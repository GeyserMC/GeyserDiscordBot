Geyser is software that you can download and run yourself, so it doesn't have an IP. That being said, there are a few Geyser-related services that do have an IP:

- If you're looking for a hosted version of the GeyserConnect software, run `!!geyserconnect` in <#613194762249437245> for more info.

- If you just want to try out Geyser, we have a test server at `test.geysermc.org` - do `!!testserver` in <#613194762249437245> for more info.
