Disable `command-suggestions` in your config. This will stop `/` from freezing Bedrock clients but will also disable command suggestions being sent.

Alternatively, you can try and reduce the amount of commands sent to Bedrock edition players - for example by using the [HideCommands extension](https://github.com/Redned235/HideCommands).
