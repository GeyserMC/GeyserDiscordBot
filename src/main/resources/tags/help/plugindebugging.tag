If you have a possible plugin interfering with Geyser or Floodgate, follow these steps to find the culprit plugin:
- Temporarily remove/move half of your plugins from your server's plugins folder.
- *If the problem persists*, remove another half.
- *If the problem goes away*, swap that half of your plugins with the other half.
- Keep repeating this pattern, this time with the half that exhibits the problem, until you find your problematic plugin.
