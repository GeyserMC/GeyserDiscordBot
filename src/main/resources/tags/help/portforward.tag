**Test your server's port forwarding**
1. Go [here](https://www.ipfingerprints.com/portscan.php)
2. Follow the guide on this picture. Use the port that your Geyser uses (19132 is the default)

Note: UDP port scanning is fairly unreliable, so this is just a possible indicator whether the port is blocked (closed), or likely open.
