The error "If you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your BungeeCord config as well!" occurs if you didn't enable IP forwarding in your BungeeCord config.
But if you did enable it, you likely have enabled "send-floodgate-data" in Floodgate's config but haven't installed Floodgate on the backend servers.
