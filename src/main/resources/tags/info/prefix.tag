The prefix is added by Floodgate to indicate that the player is Bedrock; and more importantly, to minimize the possibility of player name conflict issues.

We strongly recommend that you **do not remove** the prefix, but instead change it.

You can change the prefix (`.`) in players' names by editing the option in Floodgate's config.yml file. Characters that a Java player cannot normally choose to be part of their names are recommended.
