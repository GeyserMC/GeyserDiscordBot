title: :ocean: Floodgate Prefix
color: info

---

We strongly recommend that you **do not remove** the prefix, but instead change it. **Without a prefix, things could break, usernames would cause conflicts in commands and the users could lose their data!**

You can change the prefix in players' names by editing the option in Floodgate's config.yml file. We recommend characters that a Java player cannot normally use to avoid conflicts. Our recommended prefixes are: `.` (default), `+`, and `-`. **Using `*` as a prefix while on Windows will cause issues with some plugins.**
