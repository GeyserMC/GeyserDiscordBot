Common reason for the error `Please connect through the official Geyser` is that you have updated Geyser but not [Floodgate](https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/GeyserMC/job/Floodgate/job/master/).
You can download Floodgate at https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/GeyserMC/job/Floodgate/job/master/

Note this is not the case if all servers on your network have Floodgate updated to 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.
