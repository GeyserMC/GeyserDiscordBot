CraftBukkit and Bukkit were discontinued ages ago, and is only maintained as a base for Spigot. You should use Spigot or Paper (we recommend Paper). You can download it from the below link.

They both run all of your Bukkit plugins and worlds, so you just have to replace the Bukkit jar with a Paper one.
