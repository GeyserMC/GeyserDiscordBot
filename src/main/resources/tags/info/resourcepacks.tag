To add a Bedrock resource pack to your server, take a .zip or .mcpack file and put it in Geyser's `packs` folder. The resource pack needs to be a Bedrock resource pack, and if you only have it in Java format, you can do `!!rpconvert` in <#613194762249437245> for a link to convert Java resource packs to Bedrock ones.
