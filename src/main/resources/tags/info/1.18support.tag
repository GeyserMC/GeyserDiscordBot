Geyser's latest release supports 1.17.1 through to 1.18.

Standalone users can just [update Geyser](https://ci.opencollab.dev//job/GeyserMC/job/Geyser/job/master/) to support 1.18.

Server owners will also need to download [ViaVersion](https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion/) as well as updating [Geyser](https://ci.opencollab.dev//job/GeyserMC/job/Geyser/job/master/) (and [Floodgate](https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/GeyserMC/job/Floodgate/job/master/) if they have it installed) as there is no stable server software for 1.18 yet.
