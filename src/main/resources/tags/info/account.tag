You don't always need a paid Java Edition account to use Geyser. If the server owner has the Floodgate and Geyser plugins installed, you can join directly with only your Bedrock Edition account. See <#754458074818805811> for some servers with Floodgate. If you're setting up Geyser yourself you can also join cracked (offline mode) servers by setting `auth-type` in config.yml to `offline`, but keep in mind that Geyser doesn't condone cracked servers.
