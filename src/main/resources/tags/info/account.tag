You don't always need a paid Java Edition account to use Geyser. If the server owner has the Floodgate and Geyser plugins installed, you can join directly with only your Bedrock Edition account. If you're setting up Geyser yourself you can also join cracked (offline mode) servers by setting `auth-type` in config.yml to `offline`, but keep in mind that Geyser doesn't condone cracked servers.
