There are multiple APIs available for different purposes.

- The [Floodgate API](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/api/) allows plugins and mods to check for Bedrock players, or to get important information about them.
- The [Geyser API](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/api/) can be used to interact with Geyser itself - for example, by registering custom items or blocks, and listening to events.
- You can use the [Global API](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/global-api/) to get specific details about Bedrock players, such as linking status or converted Bedrock skins.
- Bedrock Edition features built-in GUIs. See the [Cumulus API](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/forms/) for more information on how to create and send those.
