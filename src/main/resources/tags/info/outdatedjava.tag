Geyser currently requires Java 17 or later to run. You can download Java 17 at https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
To find out how to change your Java version on hosts or other platforms, look at https://docs.papermc.io/java-install-update

If youâ€™re running a version of Paper that does not support Java 17 or later, you can add the flag `-DPaper.IgnoreJavaVersion=true` to your startup Java arguments to allow Paper to run on Java 17.
You can run Geyser standalone on another device if a server software cannot be updated to use Java 17.
