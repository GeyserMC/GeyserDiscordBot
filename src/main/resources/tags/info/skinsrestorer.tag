Currently, Geyser doesn't show skins of Bedrock players to Java players. That can be partially solved by using the SkinsRestorer plugin https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/. You can use the command `/skin set <skinURL>` to set the skin to the one you want to use. Reminder: you should use `.` instead of `*` in the name of the player when using the command if you use Floodgate, this can be altered in the Floodgate config file.
