Some hosting providers, such as OVH, SoYouStart and Oracle Cloud (OCI) have firewall setups that block UDP traffic by default.

For example, OVH's firewall requires an initial TCP ping before allowing UDP traffic, which prohibits clients from joining.
See the wiki below for info on how to resolve these issues.
