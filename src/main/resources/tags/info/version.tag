Geyser is built to only support the latest major release of Bedrock at any given time. Betas are not supported, and older version are not supported for maybe more than a minor revision or two for a limited time.

If you need to use Geyser with your own "outdated" server, you need to install [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/). You must either: use Java 16 on your server; or if your plugins are not compatible, you must either use the standalone or a Bungeecord/Velocity setup running on Java 16.

If you need to use a private standalone GeyserMC with someone else's server, look into using [VIAaaS](https://github.com/ViaVersion/VIAaaS) which has some [public instances](https://github.com/ViaVersion/VIAaaS/wiki/List-of-Public-Instances) available. The [Public GeyserConnect](https://www.geyserconnect.net/) also hosts an instance to minimize additive ping from jumping across multiple proxies in different locations.
