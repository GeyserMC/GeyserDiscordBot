The included link contains a guide on how to set up Geyser on Android using the third-party program called Termux.
https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/setup/ (navigate to self-host, then Geyser-Standalone).

Note: Applications such as Termux on Android are capable of running Geyser-Standalone, but this largely depends on how powerful your Android device is. Please do so at your own risk.
