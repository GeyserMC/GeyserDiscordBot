Use this tool to convert your Java resource pack into a Bedrock resource pack to use in Geyser's `packs` folder.

Unfortunately, this tool is not updated to support packs for versions newer than 1.17.

To convert a resource pack with CustomModelData, use the following converter: https://github.com/Kas-tle/java2bedrock.sh 
For more info on how to use it, see the pinned messages in <#1008027013161959444>. Be advised: Converting a pack to make it Bedrock compatible, especially with CustomModelData isn't always an automated process. If you need help, ask in the aforementioned channel!
