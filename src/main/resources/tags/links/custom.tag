Some conversions must be done manually. For example:
- [Converting glyphs or rank icons](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html)
- [Custom sounds](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/sounds.html). (Note: Custom sounds should be registered under a custom namespace!)
- [Armor textures](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/items/custom-armor.html).
- JSON UI can be used to create inventory menus, change scoreboard titles, and overall beautify your Minecraft Bedrock UI experience. See [JSON UI](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/json-ui/json-ui-intro.html) for more information.
