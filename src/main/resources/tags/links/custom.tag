Geyser has support for custom items and custom blocks! Player heads can also be registered to show up in the Bedrock player inventory.

For information on custom items, use the custom items link below.
For custom blocks, use the custom blocks link below.
For player heads, use the player heads link below.

Some conversions must be done manually. For example:
- [Converting glyphs or rank icons](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html)
- [Custom sounds](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/sounds.html). Do note: Custom sounds should be registered under a custom namespace!
- [Armor textures](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/items/custom-armor.html).
- JSON UI can be used to create inventory menus, change scoreboard titles, and overall beautify your Minecraft Bedrock UI experience. See [JSON UI](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/json-ui/json-ui-intro.html) for more information.

For help with Bedrock edition resource packs, <#1139296287179677857> features useful information in the pinned messages.
