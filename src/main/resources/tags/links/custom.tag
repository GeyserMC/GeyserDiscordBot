Geyser has support for custom items and custom blocks! Player heads can also be registered to show up in the Bedrock player inventory.

For information on custom items, see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-items/).
For custom blocks, see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-blocks/).
For player heads, see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-skulls/).

Some conversions must be done manually.
For converting glyphs or rank icons, see ["Custom Emojis"](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html).
For custom sounds, see ["Custom Sounds"](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/sounds.html). Do note: Custom sounds should be registered under a custom namespace!
For converting armor textures, see ["Custom Armor"](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/items/custom-armor.html#top).
JSON UI can be used to convert chest interfaces, scoreboard titles, and overall beautify your Minecraft Bedrock UI experience. See ["JSON UI"](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/json-ui/json-ui-intro.html) for more information.

For help with Bedrock edition resource packs, <#1139296287179677857> features useful information in the pinned messages.
