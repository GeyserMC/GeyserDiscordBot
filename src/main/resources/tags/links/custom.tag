Geyser has support for custom items and custom blocks! Player heads can also be registered to show up in the Bedrock player inventory. For information on custom items, blocks, and player heads, use the links below.

Some conversions must be done manually. For example:
- [Converting glyphs or rank icons](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html)
- [Custom sounds](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/sounds.html). Note: Custom sounds should be registered under a custom namespace!
- [Armor textures](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/items/custom-armor.html).
- JSON UI can be used to create inventory menus, change scoreboard titles, and overall beautify your Minecraft Bedrock UI experience. See [JSON UI](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/json-ui/json-ui-intro.html) for more information.
