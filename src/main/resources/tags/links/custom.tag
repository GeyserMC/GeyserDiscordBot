Geyser has support for custom items and custom blocks! Player heads can also be registered to show up in the Bedrock player inventory.

For information on custom items, see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-items/).
For custom blocks, see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-blocks/).
For player heads, see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-skulls/).

Some conversions must be done manually. For example:
- [Converting glyphs or rank icons](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html)
- [Custom sounds](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/sounds.html). Do note: Custom sounds should be registered under a custom namespace!
- [Armor textures](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/items/custom-armor.html).
- JSON UI can be used to create inventory menus, change scoreboard titles, and overall beautify your Minecraft Bedrock UI experience. See [JSON UI](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/json-ui/json-ui-intro.html) for more information.
