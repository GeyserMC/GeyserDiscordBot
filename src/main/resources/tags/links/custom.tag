Geyser has support for custom items and custom blocks! Player heads can also be registered to show up in the Bedrock player inventory.

For information on custom items, see https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-items/.
For custom blocks, see https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-blocks/.
For player heads, see https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/custom-skulls/.

Converting glyphs or rank icons is also possible, but done manually. https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html should help to get started.
Custom sounds are also possible - see https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/sounds.html. Do note: Custom sounds should be registered under a custom namespace!

For help with Bedrock edition resource packs, <#1139296287179677857> features useful information in the pinned messages.
