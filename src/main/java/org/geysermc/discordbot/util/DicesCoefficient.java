    /**
     * Here's an optimized version of the dice coefficient calculation. It takes
     * advantage of the fact that a bigram of 2 chars can be stored in 1 int, and
     * applies a matching algorithm of O(n*log(n)) instead of O(n*n).
     *
     * <p>Note that, at the time of writing, this implementation differs from the
     * other implementations on this page. Where the other algorithms incorrectly
     * store the generated bigrams in a set (discarding duplicates), this
     * implementation actually treats multiple occurrences of a bigram as unique.
     * The correctness of this behavior is most easily seen when getting the
     * similarity between "GG" and "GGGGGGGG", which should obviously not be 1.
     *
     * @param s1 The first string
     * @param s2 The second String
     * @return The dice coefficient between the two input strings. Returns 0 if one
     *         or both of the strings are {@code null}. Also returns 0 if one or both
     *         of the strings contain less than 2 characters and are not equal.
