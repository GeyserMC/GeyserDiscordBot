The Geyser and Floodgate BungeeCord plugins only need to be installed on the BungeeCord proxy unless you intend to use the Floodgate API. That way, you need Floodgate on the "backend" servers too.
Installing Floodgate on the backend servers also makes it so that Bedrock player's don't have to switch backend servers for their skins to start displaying.
Run `!tag api` in #bot-spam for more infomation regarding the Floodgate API.
