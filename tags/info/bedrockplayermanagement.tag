You can allow Bedrock players to bypass the anticheat or run commands on player join for your server with this plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bedrock-player-managment-for-floodgate-geyser.82278/
For anticheat you can set it up to exempt them either from all checks or the ones that cause problems on join.
Note that this plugin is unofficial and not related to GeyserMC.
