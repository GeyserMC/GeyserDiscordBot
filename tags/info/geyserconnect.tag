There is an **Unofficial** public [GeyserConnect](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserConnect) instance running. You can connect to it via
Address: `geyserconnect.gq`
Port: `17193`

**Warning:** Due to Geyser handling certain things different to a vanilla Java client you may get banned using this (see `!tag anticheat` for more info), you can also get banned on large servers when using GeyserConnect, due to the IP being banned. As well as this, if you use online mode you are sending your Java account credentials to a third party.
