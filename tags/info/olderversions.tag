Geyser currently only officially supports servers running on 1.12.2 or higher. If the server is below the latest version of the game then ViaVersion must also be installed.

You can still join servers below 1.12.2 if you run Geyser on a proxy such as Velocity or as the Standalone platform, but keep in mind that you likely won't get support on these versions irregardless of how you're running it. Versions like 1.8 are over half a decade old, and we highly recommend updating to a later version of the game.
