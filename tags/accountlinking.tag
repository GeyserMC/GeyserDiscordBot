You can use the `/linkaccount` command in game to link your accounts between Java and Bedrock. Run `/linkaccount <Bedrock username>` on Java and it will give you a command to run on Bedrock. Make sure to include the Floodgate prefix when using `/linkaccount` command. (a `*` if you did not change it) It is a Floodgate feature and more information about it can be found here:
