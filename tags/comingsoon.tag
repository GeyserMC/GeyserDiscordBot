Sometimes in Bedrock Edition, featured servers won't come up and will say `Coming Soon`. To fix that you can go to your Bedrock Settings, then to Settings Global Resources, then click get more packs and then close the menu after it loads. 
Please see the PS4 section of [this page](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Using-Geyser-with-Consoles) for ways to connect to a server from the LAN section of Minecraft.
