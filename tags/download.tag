If you wish to download and run this yourself, there are a few things to consider.
The geyserconnect is intended for bigger setups, and a private Geyserconnect instance may be useful for some private netwroks.
However, we recommend using the standalone `Geyser.jar` file from the downloads section at www.geysermc.org or to use the Geyser Android app.
