If you would like to have your server added to the Geyser Servers list on the GeyserConnect, please read on:

A few things we are implementing on our end of things:
- The GeyserMC test server and the Hoster's servers (mine) will always be at the top of the list.
- We will only have up to 10 active servers on the list. (excluding the afore mentioned ones)
- First week of each month, servers will be reviewed and potentially rotated. (Make sure you have your server's address and Discord publicly posted in your server!)

Requirements to be considered:
- You must be the owner or an authorized admin.
- less than 50 players mean average daily. (basically, calculate how many players each hour of a day, then average that. (We aren't very finicky about it, so don't worry if you can't figure this out, just give us a rough estimate of how many people actually play and come back.))
- server must be running in online mode! We do not want any servers that are running in "offline" mode do to the nature of this server. We don't want to be complicit in any legal issues if Microsoft wants to look our way.
- must have both GeyserMC and Floodgate installed on your server.
- server must be 24/7 and fully open to the public (at least one non-lobby fully playable sub-server must be public, but other sub-servers may be locked to to your verification system that you use (provided it's not an offline-auth system)).
